    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Reviclades began in 2021 with a simple conversation and a shared dream.
      We're a small, international team of friends united by our love for games
      and the ambition to create something truly meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>
      What started as a passion project has grown into a playable prototype,
      built with care, creativity, and countless hours of work. Our backgrounds
      span programming, art, and design—but it's our shared vision and your
      feedback that shape the world of Reviclades.
