  <p>
    As a young adult from the Bazula family of mighty hunters, Banzai was
    trained from an early stage of his live to guard Gorantulanâ€™s home. With
    overwhelming pride and perfect genes, he represents what is best in
    Gorantulan species. Banzai tends to be overconfident, but specifically when
    the opponent seems weak. Without any magic, he relies only on his physique
    and mind, which often grant him victory. Because of that, Banzai is sure
    that everyone has a potential to become great like him.
