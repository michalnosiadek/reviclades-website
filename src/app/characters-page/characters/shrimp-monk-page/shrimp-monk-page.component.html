      At first glance you can’t tell what kind of person
      <strong>Master Tempura </strong>is. Looking like a humble monk, he
      attracts many people willing to learn Tempura’s craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      True goal is different from just spreading knowledge. Money. Money is what
      matters for Master Tempura. Because his sensei was a humble martial art
      legend, Tempura wants to live a different life to escape his sensei’s
      shadow. Even after helping someone in distress, he expects a reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never stays in one place, scams people whenever he can, avoids fighting
      and resolves issues with money. That’s Master Tempura for you!

      „Come here good people! Today starts the recruitment for the
      <strong>Master Tempura</strong> travelling martial arts school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe it’s expensive but at least hard and demanding! But what you expect
      from the shrimp that survived on deserts for years and trained physical
      might with Gorantulans. Now it’s your chance to become like him!” ~
