  <p>
    As an old fire warrior from the ancient time of elementals, Hector does not
    follow the new age religion of fire. Even though his memory is foggy,
    remembering teaching of his god Hector wanders the fire wastelands alone,
    challenging any worthy opponent. With his pride of a true soldier, he never
    attacks creatures unwilling of fight. At times he helps travelers and
    merchants in trouble. Gloomy without a fight, showing that time took a toll
    on him, yet still glowing like a bright wildfire when battle begins.
