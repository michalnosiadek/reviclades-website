      As an old fire warrior from the ancient time of elementals, Hector does
      not follow the new age religion of fire. Even though his memory is foggy,
      remembering teaching of his god Hector wanders the fire wastelands alone,
      challenging any worthy opponent. With his pride of a true soldier, he
      never attacks creatures unwilling of fight. At times he helps travelers
      and merchants in trouble. Gloomy without a fight, showing that time took a
      toll on him, yet still glowing like a bright wildfire when battle begins.
