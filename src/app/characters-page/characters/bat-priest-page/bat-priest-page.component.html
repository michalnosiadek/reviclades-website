    <p>
      <strong>Bahrana</strong> is one of those rare cases when a Feral becomes
      intelligent to the point she can be called a genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past, one individual saved her life out of pure accident and
      decided to teach her their ways of living. Magic, languages, etiquette,
      fighting, alchemy and many other things that helped Bahrana in the future.
      With these skills she started to worship vigorously the
      <strong>Dark Lord</strong>. By deceiving people into joining the cult,
      promising immortality and chance to see again her dead relatives, she
      devours her victims. Each meal makes her stronger. Her appetite is
      infinite.
