  <p>
    As an old fire warrior from the ancient time of elementals, Hector do not
    follow new age religion of fire. Even though his memory is foggy, Hector
    remembering teaching of his god wanders fire wastelands alone challenging any
    worthy opponent. With his pride of true soldier, he never attacks creatures
    unwilling of fight. There are the times he helps travelers and merchants in
    trouble. Gloomy without a fight showing that time take toll on him, but glow
    like a bright wildfire when battle begins.
